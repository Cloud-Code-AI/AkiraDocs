Title: Analytics Integration
Learn how to add analytics tracking to your documentation
AkiraDocs supports Google Analytics 4 (GA4) out of the box. This guide will help you set up analytics tracking for your documentation.
Setting up Google Analytics
1. Create a Google Analytics 4 property in your [Google Analytics account](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Get your Measurement ID (starts with "G-")
3. Add the ID to your `akiradocs.config.json`:
Code example:
{
"analytics": {
"google": {
"measurementId": "G-XXXXXXXXXX",
"enabled": true
},
"debug": false
}
}
What's Tracked Automatically
Page views
Navigation between pages
Time on page
User language preferences
Device and browser information
Custom Event Tracking
You can track custom events using the `useAnalytics` hook:
Code example:
import { useAnalytics } from '@/hooks/useAnalytics'
function MyComponent() {
    const { track } = useAnalytics()
    const handleClick = () => {
        track('doc_rating', {
            rating: 5,
            page: 'getting-started',
            helpful: true
        })
    }
    return <button onClick={handleClick}>This was helpful</button>
}
Debug Mode
Enable debug mode to see analytics events in the console during development:
Code example:
{
"analytics": {
"debug": true
}
}
This provides a complete analytics integration that's easy for users to set up and extend as needed.
